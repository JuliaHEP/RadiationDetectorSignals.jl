# RadiationDetectorSignals.jl

A Julia package for data types to represent radiation detector signals,
especially sparse hit data and digitized waveforms.

RadiationDetectorSignals.jl is integrated with
[StructArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StructArrays.jl) for
contiguous memory layout of data. The package is also compatible with
[EncodedArrays.jl](https://github.com/oschulz/EncodedArrays.jl) to handle
compressed data.
